# Dev Jobs

## Repository

In this repository you will find the application code for a Dev Job Search application. The purpose of the application is for Developers to search for dev jobs based on a form that prompts the user for input to query the Dev Jobs database using Sequelize. This is a full stack application that is structured using MVC. Structuring the files this way helps breakdown roles when working in a group and helps keeps the code organized and easy to maintain and update. This application uses sessions and has the feature to sign up and make an account. Users who have made an account and are logged in will have access to the form to search the database and retrieve results. The API returns the following results:

- Company Name
- Location
- Job Type (Full-Time or Part-Time)
- Salary Range
- URL Link to apply 

One of the biggest challenges that were encountered while building this app was getting the database results to render on the page once the user submitted the form. We solved the issue by changing the table names inside the jobRoutes to match the Jobs Model. We also had to change the jobs.js file for the front end javascript that handles the form submission. The issue was in the document.location.replace(), We had to use a template literal and use query strings to properly render the results on the page through the jobs handlebar file.
